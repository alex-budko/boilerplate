Based on the assumptions made, here is the step-by-step plan for creating a Python snake game with React.js:

1. Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
   - Snake: Represents the snake in the game. It will have methods to move, grow, and check for collisions.
   - Food: Represents the food that the snake needs to eat. It will have methods to generate random positions.
   - Game: Manages the game state, including the snake, food, and score. It will have methods to start, pause, and reset the game.
   - GameBoard: Renders the game board and handles user input for controlling the snake.
   - App: The entry point of the React.js application. It will render the GameBoard component.

2. File Structure:
   - snake.py: Contains the Snake class.
   - food.py: Contains the Food class.
   - game.py: Contains the Game class.
   - game_board.jsx: Contains the GameBoard component.
   - app.jsx: Contains the App component.

3. Implementation:
   Let's start with the entry point file, app.jsx:

app.jsx
