Based on the assumptions made, here is the step-by-step plan for creating a Python snake game with React.js:

1. Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
   - Snake: Represents the snake in the game. It will have methods to move, grow, and check for collisions.
   - Food: Represents the food that the snake needs to eat. It will have methods to generate random positions.
   - Game: Manages the game state, including the snake, food, and score. It will have methods to start, pause, and reset the game.
   - GameBoard: Renders the game board and handles user input for controlling the snake.
   - App: The entry point of the React.js application. It will render the GameBoard component.

2. File Structure:
   - snake.py: Contains the Snake class.
   - food.py: Contains the Food class.
   - game.py: Contains the Game class.
   - game_board.jsx: Contains the GameBoard component.
   - app.jsx: Contains the App component.

3. Implementation:
   Let's start with the entry point file, app.jsx:

app.jsx
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import GameBoard from './game_board';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Snake Game</h1>
      <GameBoard />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Next, let's create the GameBoard component in game_board.jsx:

game_board.jsx
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Snake from './snake';
import Food from './food';
import Game from './game';

function GameBoard() {
  const [game, setGame] = useState(new Game());

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleKeyPress = (event) => {
      // Handle arrow key presses to control the snake
      // Update the game state accordingly
    };

    document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);

    return () => {
      document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="GameBoard">
      {/* Render the game board, snake, and food */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default GameBoard;
```

Now, let's implement the Snake class in snake.py:

snake.py
```python
class Snake:
    def __init__(self, initial_position):
        self.body = [initial_position]
        self.direction = 'right'

    def move(self):
        # Update the snake's position based on the current direction

    def grow(self):
        # Increase the length of the snake by adding a new body segment

    def check_collision(self):
        # Check if the snake has collided with itself or the game boundaries
```

Next, let's implement the Food class in food.py:

food.py
```python
import random

class Food:
    def __init__(self, board_width, board_height):
        self.position = self.generate_position(board_width, board_height)

    def generate_position(self, board_width, board_height):
        # Generate a random position for the food within the game board boundaries
```

Finally, let's implement the Game class in game.py:

game.py
```python
from snake import Snake
from food import Food

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board_width = 20
        self.board_height = 20
        self.snake = Snake((self.board_width // 2, self.board_height // 2))
        self.food = Food(self.board_width, self.board_height)
        self.score = 0
        self.is_game_over = False

    def start(self):
        # Start the game loop and update the game state

    def pause(self):
        # Pause the game

    def reset(self):
        # Reset the game state to the initial values
```

Please note that the code provided is a basic structure and does not include the complete implementation of the game logic. Additional code is required to handle the rendering of the game board, snake, and food, as well as updating the game state based on user input and checking for collisions.

Remember to add appropriate import statements and dependencies based on the chosen framework and package manager.
