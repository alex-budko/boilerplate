Here are some initial suggestions:\n\n1. BlogPost: A class representing a blog post with attributes such as title, content, author, and publication date.\n\n2. BlogPostList: A class or function that manages a list of blog posts, including methods for adding, deleting, and retrieving posts.\n\n3. BlogPostForm: A component or function that provides a form for creating or editing a blog post.\n\n4. BlogPostView: A component or function that displays the details of a single blog post.\n\n5. BlogPostListContainer: A component or function that fetches the list of blog posts from a server and passes them to the BlogPostList component.\n\n6. BlogPostAPI: A class or module that handles the communication with the server, including methods for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting blog posts.\n\n7. App: The main entry point of the application, which renders the BlogPostListContainer and other necessary components.\n\nNow, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and their contents.\n\n1. blogpost.py\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass BlogPost:\n    title: str\n    content: str\n    author: str\n    publication_date: str\n```\n\n2. blogpost_list.py\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom .blogpost import BlogPost\n\nclass BlogPostList:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.posts: List[BlogPost] = []\n\n    def add_post(self, post: BlogPost):\n        self.posts.append(post)\n\n    def delete_post(self, post: BlogPost):\n        self.posts.remove(post)\n\n    def get_posts(self) -> List[BlogPost]:\n        return self.posts\n```\n\n3. blogpost_form.jsx\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction BlogPostForm({ onSubmit }) {\n  const [title, setTitle] = useState('');\n  const [content, setContent] = useState('');\n  const [author, setAuthor] = useState('');\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    const post = {\n      title,\n      content,\n      author,\n    };\n    onSubmit(post);\n    setTitle('');\n    setContent('');\n    setAuthor('');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Title\"\n        value={title}\n        onChange={(e) => setTitle(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <textarea\n        placeholder=\"Content\"\n        value={content}\n        onChange={(e) => setContent(e.target.value)}\n      ></textarea>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Author\"\n        value={author}\n        onChange={(e) => setAuthor(e.target.value)}\n      />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default BlogPostForm;\n```\n\n4. blogpost_view.jsx\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction BlogPostView({ post }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>{post.title}</h2>\n      <p>{post.content}</p>\n      <p>Author: {post.author}</p>\n      <p>Publication Date: {post.publication_date}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default BlogPostView;\n```\n\n5. blogpost_list_container.jsx\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';\nimport BlogPostList from './blogpost_list';\nimport BlogPostAPI from './blogpost_api';\n\nfunction BlogPostListContainer() {\n  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchPosts = async () => {\n      const posts = await BlogPostAPI.getPosts();\n      setPosts(posts);\n    };\n    fetchPosts();\n  }, []);\n\n  const handleDelete = async (post) => {\n    await BlogPostAPI.deletePost(post);\n    setPosts(posts.filter((p) => p.id !== post.id));\n  };\n\n  return <BlogPostList posts={posts} onDelete={handleDelete} />;\n}\n\nexport default BlogPostListContainer;\n```\n\n6. blogpost_api.py\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom .blogpost import BlogPost\n\nclass BlogPostAPI:\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_posts() -> List[BlogPost]:\n        # Implementation to fetch blog posts from the server\n        pass\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def create_post(post: BlogPost):\n        # Implementation to create a new blog post on the server\n        pass\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def update_post(post: BlogPost):\n        # Implementation to update an existing blog post on the server\n        pass\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def delete_post(post: BlogPost):\n        # Implementation to delete a blog post from the server\n        pass\n```\n\n7. app.jsx\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport BlogPostListContainer from './blogpost_list_container';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Blog</h1>\n      <BlogPostListContainer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nThis is a basic structure for a blog program using React.
