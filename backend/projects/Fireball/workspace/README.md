To create a blog program using React, we can start by identifying the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary. Here are some initial suggestions:

1. BlogPost: A class representing a blog post with attributes such as title, content, author, and publication date.

2. BlogPostList: A class or function that manages a list of blog posts, including methods for adding, deleting, and retrieving posts.

3. BlogPostForm: A component or function that provides a form for creating or editing a blog post.

4. BlogPostView: A component or function that displays the details of a single blog post.

5. BlogPostListContainer: A component or function that fetches the list of blog posts from a server and passes them to the BlogPostList component.

6. BlogPostAPI: A class or module that handles the communication with the server, including methods for fetching, creating, updating, and deleting blog posts.

7. App: The main entry point of the application, which renders the BlogPostListContainer and other necessary components.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and their contents.
