Based on the assumptions made, here is the proposed architecture for the 'blog' program using React:

1. Entry Point File:
   - File Name: index.js
   - Purpose: This file serves as the entry point for the React application. It renders the root component and mounts it to the DOM.

2. Root Component:
   - File Name: App.js
   - Purpose: This component serves as the root component of the React application. It handles the routing and renders the appropriate components based on the URL.

3. Blog List Component:
   - File Name: BlogList.js
   - Purpose: This component displays a list of blog posts. It fetches the blog data from the backend and renders individual BlogItem components for each blog post.

4. Blog Item Component:
   - File Name: BlogItem.js
   - Purpose: This component represents an individual blog post. It displays the title, author, and summary of the blog post. It also provides a link to view the full blog post.

5. Blog Detail Component:
   - File Name: BlogDetail.js
   - Purpose: This component displays the full content of a blog post. It fetches the blog post data from the backend and renders the title, author, content, and comments for the blog post.

6. Comment Component:
   - File Name: Comment.js
   - Purpose: This component represents a comment on a blog post. It displays the author and content of the comment.

Now, let's proceed with the code implementation for each file:

index.js
