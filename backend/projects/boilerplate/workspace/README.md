To create a snake game using HTML and any framework, we can follow the following steps:

1. Create a `Snake` class to represent the snake in the game. This class will have properties such as `position`, `direction`, and `length`, as well as methods to move the snake and check for collisions.

2. Create a `Food` class to represent the food that the snake needs to eat. This class will have properties such as `position` and a method to generate a new random position for the food.

3. Create a `Game` class to manage the game logic. This class will have properties such as the `snake` object, the `food` object, and the game `score`. It will also have methods to start the game, update the game state, handle user input, and check for game over conditions.

4. Create an HTML file to display the game. This file will include a canvas element to draw the game board, as well as any necessary CSS styles.

5. Use JavaScript to handle user input and update the game state. This can be done by adding event listeners to capture keyboard input and calling the appropriate methods on the `Game` object.

Now let's proceed with creating the necessary files and code:
