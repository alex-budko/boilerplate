To create a snake game using HTML and any framework, we can follow the following steps:

1. Create a `Snake` class to represent the snake in the game. This class will have properties such as `position`, `direction`, and `length`, as well as methods to move the snake and check for collisions.

2. Create a `Food` class to represent the food that the snake needs to eat. This class will have properties such as `position` and a method to generate a new random position for the food.

3. Create a `Game` class to manage the game logic. This class will have properties such as the `snake` object, the `food` object, and the game `score`. It will also have methods to start the game, update the game state, handle user input, and check for game over conditions.

4. Create an HTML file to display the game. This file will include a canvas element to draw the game board, as well as any necessary CSS styles.

5. Use JavaScript to handle user input and update the game state. This can be done by adding event listeners to capture keyboard input and calling the appropriate methods on the `Game` object.

Now let's proceed with creating the necessary files and code:

**snake.py**
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Snake:
    position: list
    direction: str
    length: int

    def move(self):
        # Move the snake based on the current direction
        pass

    def check_collision(self):
        # Check if the snake has collided with itself or the game boundaries
        pass

    def change_direction(self, new_direction):
        # Change the direction of the snake
        pass

@dataclass
class Food:
    position: list

    def generate_position(self):
        # Generate a new random position for the food
        pass

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.snake = Snake(position=[(0, 0)], direction='right', length=1)
        self.food = Food(position=[(5, 5)])
        self.score = 0

    def start(self):
        # Start the game loop
        pass

    def update(self):
        # Update the game state
        pass

    def handle_input(self, event):
        # Handle user input
        pass

    def check_game_over(self):
        # Check if the game is over
        pass
```

**index.html**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Snake Game</title>
    <style>
        /* Add CSS styles for the game */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="gameCanvas"></canvas>

    <script src="game.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**game.js**
```javascript
// Create a new instance of the Game class
const game = new Game();

// Add event listeners to handle user input
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
    game.handle_input(event);
});

// Start the game
game.start();
```

Please note that the code provided is a basic structure for the snake game and may require additional implementation to handle game logic, rendering, and other functionalities.
