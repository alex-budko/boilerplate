Entry Point File:\n   - File Name: index.js\n   - Purpose: This file serves as the entry point for the React application. It renders the root component and mounts it to the DOM.\n\n2. Root Component:\n   - File Name: App.js\n   - Purpose: This component serves as the root component of the React application. It handles the routing and renders the appropriate components based on the URL.\n\n3. Blog List Component:\n   - File Name: BlogList.js\n   - Purpose: This component displays a list of blog posts. It fetches the blog data from the backend and renders individual BlogItem components for each blog post.\n\n4. Blog Item Component:\n   - File Name: BlogItem.js\n   - Purpose: This component represents an individual blog post. It displays the title, author, and summary of the blog post. It also provides a link to view the full blog post.\n\n5. Blog Detail Component:\n   - File Name: BlogDetail.js\n   - Purpose: This component displays the full content of a blog post. It fetches the blog post data from the backend and renders the title, author, content, and comments for the blog post.\n\n6. Comment Component:\n   - File Name: Comment.js\n   - Purpose: This component represents a comment on a blog post.
