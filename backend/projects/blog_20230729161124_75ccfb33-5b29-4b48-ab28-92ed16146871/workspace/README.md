Based on the assumptions made, here is the proposed architecture for the 'blog' program:

1. `blog.py` (Entrypoint file)
   - This file will serve as the entrypoint for the program.
   - It will handle the routing and request handling for the blog application.

2. `blog_controller.py`
   - This file will contain the controller class responsible for handling the blog-related operations.
   - It will have methods for creating, editing, and deleting blog posts, as well as retrieving blog posts.

3. `blog_post.py`
   - This file will define the data structure for a blog post.
   - It will contain a class representing a blog post, with attributes such as title, content, author, and creation date.

4. `blog_view.py`
   - This file will define the view class responsible for rendering the blog posts to the user.
   - It will have methods for displaying the list of blog posts, as well as individual blog posts.

Now, let's proceed with creating the content of each file.

`blog.py`
