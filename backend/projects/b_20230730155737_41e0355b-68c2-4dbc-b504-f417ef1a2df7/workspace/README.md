Based on the assumptions made, let's proceed with the following steps:

1. Identify the core classes, functions, and methods needed for the 'blog' program:
   - BlogPost: Represents a blog post with attributes such as title, content, author, and publication date.
   - BlogManager: Manages the creation, editing, and deletion of blog posts.
   - BlogRenderer: Renders the blog posts for display to users.

2. Create the necessary files for the 'blog' program:
   - `blog.py`: The entrypoint file that initializes the blog and handles user interactions.
   - `blog_post.py`: Contains the `BlogPost` class definition.
   - `blog_manager.py`: Contains the `BlogManager` class definition.
   - `blog_renderer.py`: Contains the `BlogRenderer` class definition.

Let's start by creating the `blog.py` file.
